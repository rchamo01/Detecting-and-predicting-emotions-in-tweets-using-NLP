TWITTER EMOTION ANALYZER
This is a Dash app which fetches and classifies tweets from a given username. It also generates cool visualizations from the processed data.

It was our final project for the 2nd Edition Samsung Innovation Campus AI Course with the University of MÃ¡laga (UMA).

REQUIREMENTS AND VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT

First off, make sure you are in the project folder.

Then execute this file in order to activate the virtual environment we created:

./project_venv/Scripts/activate

Once you have activated the venv (it should show in parentheses in your console), use the package manager pip to install the required packages from requirements.txt:

pip install -r requirements.txt

RUNNING THE APP

Once the virtual environment is active and requirements are installed, run the app.py file:

python app.py
